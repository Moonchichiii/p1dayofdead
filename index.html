            <h2>Reasons why</h2><br>
    
                <p>
                  I created a website about the Day of the Dead festival as a way to share my passion for this colorful and meaningful celebration. Initially, I had planned to create a website about Alexander the Great's mother, but after not finding any pictures online, I became stressed and started to look for other topics to explore.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As I thought about what inspired me, I remembered my travels to Mexico over a decade ago and the vivid memories of the Day of the Dead celebrations. The idea stuck, and I decided to create a website to share the history, traditions, and beauty of this unique and fascinating festival.

        <h2>This documentary</h2><br>
            <p>Explores the history and evolution of the Mexican Day of the Dead, from its pagan origins to modern practices.</p>
             <p>It follows artist Betsabee Romero, curator Laura Osorio Sunnucks, and paleobiologist Omar Regalado Fernandez
                 as they discuss the various ways people remember and honor the deceased, including cooking, eating, drinking,
                 music-making, and decorating graves.</p>
             <p>The film highlights the importance of the "spirit of things" and the love shared through these rituals.</p>
