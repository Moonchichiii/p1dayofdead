                <p>
                  I created a website about the Day of the Dead festival as a way to share my passion for this colorful and meaningful celebration. Initially, I had planned to create a website about Alexander the Great's mother, but after not finding any pictures online, I became stressed and started to look for other topics to explore.

                  As I thought about what inspired me, I remembered my travels to Mexico over a decade ago and the vivid memories of the Day of the Dead celebrations. The idea stuck, and I decided to create a website to share the history, traditions, and beauty of this unique and fascinating festival.
