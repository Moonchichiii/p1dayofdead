        <h2 aria-label="a short story about the orgins">Long ago</h2>
        <p>in a small Mexican village, the people lived in harmony with the cycles of life and death. They believed that when a person passed away, their spirit would continue to exist in a different realm, watching over their loved ones.</p>
<p>
            One year, during a particularly difficult harvest season, the villagers sought guidance from their elder, Don Mateo. He advised them to honor the spirits of their ancestors, who they believed could bring blessings to the living. The villagers, desperate for a bountiful harvest, decided to follow Don Mateo's counsel.</p>
            <p>
            They began by preparing a feast with the ancestors' favorite foods and drinks. As they cooked and sang, they shared stories of their departed loved ones, keeping their memories alive. They decorated the village with colorful flowers and candles, creating a path to guide the spirits back to the realm of the living.</p>

        <p >the villagers gathered in the local cemetery to continue the celebration. They adorned the graves with more flowers and candles, and continued sharing stories and singing songs. It was said that the spirits of their ancestors joined them in the festivities, delighting in the love and warmth that the living offered.</p>
            <p>
            This beautiful celebration became an annual tradition, and over time, the villagers noticed that their harvests improved. The people believed that their ancestors were grateful for the love and honor they received, and in return, blessed them with good fortune.</p>
            <p>
            Word of this wondrous celebration spread to neighboring villages, and soon, the entire region embraced the tradition. The Day of the Dead, as it came to be known, was born out of love, respect, and gratitude for those who had passed on, and it remains a cherished celebration to this day.</p>
