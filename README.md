<h1>Milestone 1 Project: Day of the Dead</h1>
I created a website about the Day of the Dead festival as a way to share my passion for this colorful and meaningful celebration that I had the pleasure to experience.

As I thought about what inspires me, I remembered my travels to Mexico and the vivid memories of the Day of the Dead celebrations. The idea stuck, so I decided to create a website to share its history, traditions, and beauty of this unique and fascinating festival.

<h2>UX</h2>

This website is designed to provide a fun, simple and informative user experience, focusing on the history, traditions, and beauty of the Day of the Dead festival.
The design is fun and colorful, with a variety of images showcasing the vibrant colors and unique aspects of the celebration. 

The mobile menu, which transforms into a crossboned skull as the user scrolls down the page, adds a playful and thematic touch to the browsing experience on smaller screens.

a small display of how it looks on the page, in the photos below.

<h4>Technologies Used</h4>

<em>For this project, I used the following technologies:</em>

- HTML5

- CSS

- Font Awesome 4

<h4>Testing</h4>

- HTML Validator: https://validator.w3.org/
- CSS Validator: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/

I ran the tests on each file, fixed errors and the files are now validated.

During the testing phase, I spent time working on the responsive design element. 
I tested this by using Google Chrome's dev tools and changing the width of the screen. I then used media queries.

On all the pages in the footer is a subscription to the newsletter form with validation in mind.

<h4>Deployment</h4>

This project is deployed on GitHub Pages.

In 2015, the British Museum celebrated the Days of the Dead in a four-day festival full of color, music, storytelling, and art. This beautiful documentary introduces the history and evolution of the Mexican Day of the Dead, from its pagan beginnings to the multi-faceted ceremony it is today.
