Milestone 1 Project: Day of the Dead
I created a website about the Day of the Dead festival as a way to share my passion for this colorful and meaningful celebration. Initially, I had planned to create a website about Alexander the Great's mother, but after not finding any pictures online, I became stressed and started to look for other topics to explore.

As I thought about what inspired me, I remembered my travels to Mexico over a decade ago and the vivid memories of the Day of the Dead celebrations. The idea stuck, and I decided to create a website to share the history, traditions, and beauty of this unique and fascinating festival.

UX

This website provides an engaging and informative user experience, focusing on the history, traditions, and beauty of the Day of the Dead festival.
The design is visually appealing, with a variety of images showcasing the vibrant colors and unique aspects of the celebration. 

The mobile menu, which transforms into a crossboned skull as the user scrolls down the page, adds a playful and thematic touch to the browsing experience on smaller screens.

Technologies Used

For this project, I used the following technologies:

HTML5
CSS
Font Awesome 4

Testing

HTML Validator: https://validator.w3.org/
CSS Validator: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/

I ran the tests on each file, fixed errors and the files are now validated.

During the testing phase, I spent time working on the responsive design element. 
I tested this by using Google Chrome's dev tools and changing the width of the screen. I then used media queries.

On all the pages in the footer is a subscription to the newsletter form with validation in mind.

Deployment

This project is deployed on GitHub Pages.
