        Pan de Muerto, or "Bread of the Dead," is a traditional Mexican sweet bread typically prepared for the Day of the Dead (Día de Muertos) celebrations. Here's a simple recipe for making Pan de Muerto:</p><br>

<h4>Ingredients:</h4><br>
<ol>
    <li>4 cups (500g) all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon active dry yeast</li>
    <li>1/2 cup (120ml) warm water</li>
    <li>1/2 cup (120ml) warm milk</li>
    <li>3/4 cup (170g) unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly</li>
    <li>4 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon orange zest</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h5>For the glaze:</h5><br>
<ol>
<li>1/4 cup (60ml) orange juice</li>
<li>1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar</li>
<li>Additional granulated sugar for sprinkling</li>
</ol>

<h4>Instructions:</h4><br>
<ol>
<li>In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes, or until it becomes frothy.</li><br>
<li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture, warm milk, melted butter, beaten eggs, orange zest, and vanilla extract. Mix everything together until a sticky dough forms.</li><br>
<li>Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for 10 minutes, or until it becomes smooth and elastic. If necessary, add more flour to prevent the dough from sticking to the surface.</li><br>
<li>Form the dough into a ball and place it in a greased bowl. Cover it with a damp cloth and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.</li><br>
<li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li><br>
<li>Once the dough has risen, punch it down and transfer it to a lightly floured surface. Reserve a small portion of the dough (about 1/4) to create the bone decorations. Shape the remaining dough into a round loaf and place it on the prepared baking sheet.</li><br>
<li>Divide the reserved dough into several pieces and roll them into ropes. Arrange the ropes on top of the loaf in a crisscross pattern to resemble bones. You can also create a small round ball of dough and place it in the center to represent a skull.</li><br>
<li>Let the loaf rise again for 20-30 minutes, or until it has slightly increased in size.</li><br>
<li>Bake the Pan de Muerto in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until it becomes golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped.</li><br>
<li>While the bread is baking, prepare the glaze by combining the orange juice and sugar in a small saucepan. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar dissolves. Remove from heat and set aside.</li><br>
<li>Once the bread is done, remove it from the oven and immediately brush it with the glaze. Sprinkle with additional granulated sugar while the glaze is still wet.</li><br>
<li>Allow the Pan de Muerto to cool slightly before serving. Enjoy it as a part of your Day of the Dead celebration or with a cup of coffee or hot chocolate.</li><br>
<li>Note: Pan de Muerto is best enjoyed fresh, but you can store it in an airtight container for up to 3 days.</li>
