        <li>The Mexico City Metro has a station at Terminal Aerea, just a short walk from Terminal 1. It is an affordable and efficient way to reach the city center. Be aware that the Metro can get crowded during rush hours, and you may need to change lines depending on your destination.</li></ol></div>
        <div class="plan">
            <h4>Metrobus:</h4>
        <ol>

            <div class="plan">
                <h4>Rideshare:</h4>
            <ol>

                <li> Apps like Uber and Didi operate in Mexico City, offering a convenient way to book a ride directly from your smartphone. Keep in mind that it might be a bit more expensive than other options, but it provides a comfortable and personalized service.</li>
